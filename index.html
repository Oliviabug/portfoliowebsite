				<p> Olivia Bugault,</p> 
				<p>datajournalist, </p>

				<p>I am currently completing a MSc Computational and Data Journalism Master at Cardiff University and I previously got an Economic and Management Licence degree and a Master’s in Marketing, both at La Sorbonne University in Paris.
        </p>

				<p>Over these years I have developed my professional career in a wide range of companies. I worked as a market research analyst for Canal +, as a product manager for UniversCine and as a manager and commercial assistant at Floxia Int.
        </p>

				<p>Along with my strong interest in economics and business, I realised I would like to focus my career on journalism. That’s why I worked as a journalist for Le Petit Journal de Hong Kong, an online newspaper for the French expats’ community in 2017. Previously, I got an internship at an audiovisual production company called La Feelgood Company and I also worked as an intern journalist for the magazine Marie Claire. </p>

				<p>Thanks to the Master’s Degree I am currently studying, I can analyse big datasets and visualize them properly with the coding skills I have gained in languages such as Python and JavaScript (d3 included).
       </p>

				<p>I am fluent in French and in English.
