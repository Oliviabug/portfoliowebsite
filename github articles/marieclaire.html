        <h1>Is unemployment contagious at 50 years old? - Testimony</h1>

        <p><strong>For eight years, Margaux Gilquin has alternated between unemployment and insecure jobs. Today, she is still looking for a regular job.
           She relates the tale of this uphill battle in a book entitled “The Last Salary”. In it, she reveals with irony and anger her pains and constant
            job research.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Olivia Bugault: Why did you talk about your misfortune in a book?</strong></p>
        <p>Margaux Gilquin: I was so angry because I fought hard after my layoff in 2008 to find a new position.
           Today, I live with 487 euros a month. I wanted people to know that no one wants to be “assisted”; no one wants
            to sell their furniture as I did. I turn my anger into courage with this book. I don’t lose time anymore: I move forward.</p>
            <br>

         <p><strong>“We can do it if we want to”: is this maxim true when, as you, we faced seven years of professional hurdles?</strong></p>
         <p>No, it is not. To wish is not enough. Recruiters are not allowed or don’t want to hire seniors. Recently, an employer was searching
          for commercials and told me: “I cannot hire you because, after fifty years, your capacity to integrate information has decreased”. I really heard it!</p>

         <p><strong>Reading your book, it seems that job centres are unable to efficiently help you.</strong></p>
         <p>Since I moved near Bordeaux, my job advisers really take care of me. But in Paris it was awful.
           You have to register and fill a form to know if you are eligible for allowances. Then, there is no support,
            no one to explain you the methodology, the complexity of the process.  I didn’t know how to look for a job.
            At 50 years old, we don’t know how to use employment research website. I lost time because of their incompetence, lack of reactivity and information provided.</p>

          <p><strong>Is unemployment contagious?</strong></p>
          <p>Unemployment can happen to everyone so it’s frightening. I lost many friends during my unemployment
             period and those I have today often are in the same situation than me. At the beginning, it was frustrating
              but my priority was to find a work. It was hard enough to stick on my tight budget so even if friendship is important,
               I tried to not get irritated by this problem.</p>

           <p><strong>Are there only two options for newcomers on the labour market: be a shark or get crushed?</strong></p>
          <p>Today, people learn how to survive in the labour market. The young recruiters I met have cut their teeth on job seekers
             in a way they probably learned in business schools. There is no humanity during an interview. I got interviews with young
              women who told me: “Listen grandma, you are still an assistant at 50 years old whereas me, I am a project manager”.
              It’s craven but can we be angry with victims of the system? I am not mad at them.</p>

            <p><strong>How do you manage to live with 487 euros per month?</strong></p>
            <p>You have to account for your spending every day. I have shoes that I need to repair
              but I don’t have the money for it. I don’t smoke anymore. And I don’t hang out with my friends neither.
               But I have been raised poorly so it’s not the problem. The real difference is that I see people enjoying
                their life all around me while I am struggling for a job, for my survival. It hurts deeply.</p>

            <p><strong>However, your book is full of self-mockery and humour…</strong></p>
            <p>It’s crucial otherwise you just hang yourself! I said it to the Minister of Labour, Myriam El Khomri.
               She invited me because she liked my book. We spent one and a half hour together. But when she asked me how I
                envisioned my future, I answered “at the end of a rope”!</p>
