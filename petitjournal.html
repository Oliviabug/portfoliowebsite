        <h1>Is Hong Kong too reliant on China?</h1>

                <p>Hong Kong is a crucial partner of China. Its position is its greatest strength.
                   Part of the Chinese territory, it is also connected to the international market.
                    However, there are few red flags.</p>

          <p> Twenty years have passed since Hong Kong returned to the bosom of China under the status of Special Administrative Region (SAR).
             During the handover of their colony the British negotiated a main point: Hong Kong will preserve great independence
              including its own legal system for the 50 years following the signature of the treaty.</p>

            <p>This independence is commercially profitable as the region is considered one of the most liberal and efficient capitalist
               markets in the world.</p>

            <p>But is this economic success in danger? Has Hong Kong become too reliant on its motherland?</p>

            <p><strong>Parallels in Growth Rates</strong></p>

            <p>Beijing foresaw a 6.5% GDP growth for 2017. A lower projection than the 6.7% 2016’s GDP growth which
               was the slowest increase for 26 years.</p>

            <p>If France would give anything for such a growth, for China this is the sign of a new and less opulent economic era.
               The country grew at an exponential speed for decades with an average rate of almost 10%.</p>

            <p>And when the second most powerful world economy slows down, other countries suffer too.</p>

            <p>Indeed, in Hong Kong the economic slowdown adopts a similar pace than the Chinese one.
               With a 1.9% GDP growth in 2016 and a 2.4% forecast for this year, the figures indicate a clear
                slowdown in comparison with 1980 to 2015, a period with an average growth rate of 5%.</p>

            <p><strong>Chinese customers: the crème de la crème</strong></p>

            <p>Between Hong Kong and China, there are few coincidences and many casual links.</p>

            <p>Hong Kong is a bridge between China and the rest of the world. The region is a trusted partner for Beijing
               as for the Western world thanks to its famous principle: “One country, two systems”.
                Geographically part of China, the region’s economy is part of globalization.</p>

            <p>Hong Kong has made the most of this feature. The region became a regional hub and a trustworthy financial
               and trading intermediary. Important commercial doorway to China, more than half of its exports are
                shipped to China.</p>

            <p>But China has increased its openness to the world since the beginning of the 21st century.
               More and more, foreign investors directly deal with China for business to the detriment of Hong Kong.</p>

            <p>Hong Kong Victoria Harbour is a good illustration of this new context.
               Until 2004, the commercial harbour was the world’s busiest harbour in terms of containers
                handled. Ever since, the harbour fell in the ranking to the fifth position in 2015.
                 Victoria Harbour handled 20.1 million containers this year.</p>

            <p>Four harbours including three Chinese ones surpassed Victoria Harbour:
              Shanghai, Shenzhen and Ningbo. These huge competitors are financially supported by the Chinese
               party. </p>

            <p>Another indicator puts the spotlight on Hong Kong’s loss of importance in the Chinese economy:
               the region’s weight in the Chinese GDP.
               Hong Kong’s economy relative to China’s GDP has fallen from a peak of 27% in 1993 to less than 3% in 2017.</p>

            <p><strong>Hong Kong: for the love of consumption</strong></p>

            <p>Causeway Bay is the place to go shopping in Hong Kong. Chinese people flock to this area to spend their money on luxury brands for goods like jewellery and watches. They take advantage of lower import taxes on goods to spend lavishly.</p>
            <p>But recently, Chinese tourism’s consumption decreased in Hong Kong. First because China faced a slight recession and second, because Hong Kong is not the only country offering attractive prices anymore.</p>
            <p>This is another hard blow for Hong Kong. Retail sales heavily depend on Chinese tourists who represent 70% of the total annual number of tourists in the SAR. And tourism and associated sectors like transportation account for 35% of Hong Kong’s GDP with 1.4 million of employees.</p>
            <p>The main perverse effects on the economy are shops closing and rent lowering in commercial areas.</p>
